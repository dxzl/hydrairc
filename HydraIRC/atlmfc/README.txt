Visual Studio 2015 Community automatically installs atlmfc libraries
with C++ so you no longer need to copy them to this folder.

Install Visual Studio 2015 Community from:
https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/products/visual-studio-community-vs.aspx

(ATLMFC is also available in the Windows Driver SDK or do a search
on your computer for it - you need the newest version as of 8/30/2015)

You might also install the Windows 10 SDK:
