As of 10/21/2016, compiling this on Visual Studio Community 2015, the
GitHub Readme.md says this entire project IS now under GPL, I've seen no
activity by Dominic and I did try to contact him and recieved no
response... meanwhile, my github fork just sat there gathering e-dust,
so I am going to release my version (which took much effort and hard work)
as its own distribution, under GPL v3. - Scott Swift

The text below is from the original distribution:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

License & Distribution Rights
=============================

HydraIRC is currently free to use.  It will remain free for private use
but there will most likely be a charge to use it for commercial use after
v1.0 is released.

Commercial users are NOT licensed to use versions prior to v1.0 when v1.0
is released.

Anyone who is a politician or who works for any form of government body
is expressly forbidden to use any version of HydraIRC.

Fileplanet.com and any other site requiring membership of any kind before
users are allowed to download HydraIRC are expressly forbidden from
hosting any HydraIRC files on their site.

If you want to re-distribute HydraIRC then I (Dominic Clifton / Hydra) must
be contacted first.  Drop an e-mail to hydra at hydrairc dot com if you
require permission.

I'm not liable for anything at all.
